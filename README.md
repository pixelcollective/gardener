# Gardener
Configuration of Roots stack (Trellis/Bedrock/Sage/Soil) based on command-line prompts.

## Why?
I had to transfer approximately 80 million sites out of a multisite after a panic attack about my egg to basket ratio. I got really tired of cloning Trellis.

## How?
* `yarn`
* `node gardener.js`
* Answer the prompts.
* Be prepared to grant permissions.

## Why is this so garbage?
Because it's garbage, ok? Hot, useful garbage. Submit a PR. I have things to tend to (ha!)

## Things to know?
This script DOES NOT configure WP salts. Maybe one day I'll have time to return and automate this as well. But, yeah, you know how "maybe one day" tends to go.

I'm assuming you've followed the Trellis docs and your machine is flush to the vagrants with all the Ansibles. Honestly, if this is a shortcut for you I would strongly suggest doing an install or twelve and then using this as a jumping off point once you're comfy (and sick of installing).

You can play around with the config files in `~./configs/trellis/...` to your liking. What's in there is what's in there because that's what I needed to customize.

## License
Be free. Be kind to others. Especially those who get the short end of the societal stick. Give your money to Roots.
